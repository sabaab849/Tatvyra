# Tatvyra

The official website for **Tatvyra** — clean-label wellness essentials from
Feynman Foodcraft Pvt. Ltd.

> Rise. Nourish. Thrive.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build into dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
npm run lint     # oxlint
```

## Stack

React 19 + React Router 7 on Vite 8, with hand-written CSS driven by design
tokens. No UI kit, no CSS framework, no animation library — the only runtime
dependencies are React, React DOM and React Router.

## Routes

| Path | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home |

Client-side routing: any host serving this build must rewrite unknown paths to
`index.html`.

## Adding or editing products

Everything lives in `src/data/catalogue.js`. A SKU looks like:

```js
{
  sku: 'TAT-NB01',
  slug: 'natural-peanut-butter-creamy',
  name: 'Natural Peanut Butter, Creamy',
  category: 'nut-butters',
  format: 'Spread',
  focus: '30% 50%',   // crop of the range photo, until a packshot exists
  zoom: 1,
  descriptor: 'Peanuts, milled creamy. Nothing hydrogenated, nothing added.',
  sizes: ['250g', '500g', '1000g'],
  benefits: [...],    // verbatim from the catalogue
  marks: ['clean-label', 'vegan', 'nutrition-forward'],
  price: null,        // no prices are published yet
  featured: true,
}
```

Add `image: '/images/...'` for a card packshot, or `images: [{ src, alt }]` for
a gallery. Mark keys must exist in `MARKS` in `src/data/brand.js`, and a mark
may only be applied where the catalogue's own definition allows it.

**Read `BRAND-NOTES.md` before changing colour, type, the logo or product copy.**
It records which brand rules are enforced in code and which facts are missing on
purpose.

## Accessibility

Semantic landmarks and one `<h1>` per route, a skip link, visible focus rings,
Escape-to-close and focus-trapped drawers, labelled controls, `aria-pressed` on
filters and size toggles, alt text on every image, and a full
`prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out. All text tints are mixed to clear WCAG AA on
their ground — see the colour section of `BRAND-NOTES.md`.
